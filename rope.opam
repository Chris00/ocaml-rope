synopsis: "Ropes (heavyweight strings)"
description: """
Ropes ("heavyweight strings") are a scalable string implementation:
they are designed for efficient operation that involve the string as a
whole.  Operations such as concatenation, and substring take time that
is nearly independent of the length of the string.  Unlike strings,
ropes are a reasonable representation for very long strings such as
edit buffers or mail messages.
